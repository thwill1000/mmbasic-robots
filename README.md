MMBasic port by @Volhout, Martin Herhaus & friends 2024

__NOTE__: This repository is specifically for maintaining a version compatible with [MMBasic for Linux](https://github.com/thwill1000/mmb4l) (MMB4L). Though in theory it should also run on [PicoMiteVGA](https://geoffg.net/picomitevga.html) and [Game*Mite](https://github.com/thwill1000/mmbasic-gamemite) platforms too; if it doesn't then give me a poke.

__"Official"__ MMBasic versions for PicoMiteVGA and Game*Mite are maintained by @Volhout and can be found in his [archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18vSlVojm9GLIj1PiQLVLKtcdMqg4uiQV?usp=sharing).

@Volhout and the other developers of the MMBasic port can be found on [The Back Shed Forum](https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/ViewForum.php?FID=16) with the latest thread discussing the PETSCII Robots port being [this one](https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/ViewTopic.php?TID=16487).
